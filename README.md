# react-code-review-checklist
An opinionated code-review checklist for React applications.

## Keep code DRY (Don't repeat yourself)

## Enforce propTypes

### Use shape for propTypes wherever applicable

## No commented code

## Keep components small

## Event listeners removed

## setState callback function is used

## JSX markup should be no more than 50 lines

## Stateless components for components that don't use state

## Naming conventions followed for variables, file names, translations

## No unused variables and functions/methods

## Removed unused packages from NPM

## No api calls in containers, delegate to Stores

## Use <Link /> instead of <a />

## No unused props are being passed

## Should have descriptive comments to functions/code, even one liner 

## Store mock data for unit tests, avoid cluttering of mock code

## Create mock data using loops, for easy maintainability 

## No state updates in loop

## Move data to constants if used in multiple files, like statusText and status code

## Use fat arrow instead of var that = this

## Use let/const over var

## Use '' in JS code and "" in JSX

## No useless constructor
